1. Intro                                                    *vim-wrangler-intro*

Wrangler is an Erlang refactoring tool.  It covers structural changes such as
renaming of functions, modules and variables or extracting existing code to
the new function. Wrangler can be used across a whole project. More about
wrangler: https://github.com/RefactoringTools/wrangler.

The purpose of this plugin is to exploit  power of Wrangler in Vim.  Wrangler
runs on separate erlang node that is started at the beginning and then reused
for the subseqent calls. To comunicate with the node plugin uses erl_call
command which is part of the erl_interface application:
http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl_call.html.

The project started from taking vimerl's wrangler-support branch
(https://github.com/jimenezrick/vimerl/tree/wrangler-support) that has an old
version support. The branch is no longer in developement so I decided to write
my own version that will be working with the latest version of Wrangler.

This extension doesn't include Wrangler. One should install aproperiate version
of the library and pass the installation path via g:erlangWranglerPath.

2. Options                                                *vim-wrangler-options*

                                                         *'g:erlangWranglerPath'*

Use this option to pass path to the wrangler directory. Without this variable
the plugin won't be enabled. It should point at the toplevel directory.  >
    let g:erlangWranglerPath = '/Users/pawel.pikula/dev/other/wrangler'
